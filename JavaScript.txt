there are two types of programming languages:
	server side : back-end programs; like: PHP, Java, ...
	client side : front-end programs; like: JavaScript, Angular, React, ...

there's also another categorization:
	compiled languages: like C, C++, C#, Java
	interpreted languages: like Python, JS

Use a semicolon ';' to end your lines.
Use backslash '/' to comment a line of code

put a <script></script> tag after your <body></body> tag and write your inline js codes,
or you can write them in an external .js file and import them like:
<script src:'file.js'></script>


to make a variable : 
	var my_name = 'hello';
	var names = ['me', 'you']
	//creating and accessing arrays is just like lists in python
	//or we can create them like:
	var names = new Array('me', 'you')

booleans: true, false

alert('my message')
alert('my message' + my_name)
alert(typeof my_name );

document.write(my_name)
document.write('<br/>)


to make a function:
	function my_func(){
		.
		.
		.
	}

to call the function when a <a></a> tag is clicked, define it like this:
	<script src="javascript.js"></script>
	<a href='#' onclick='my_func()'> Click! </a>

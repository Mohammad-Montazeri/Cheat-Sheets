# Description

In this repository, I have collected some of the pamphlets/cheat-sheets which I have gathered while learning each of the languages/subjects. These cheat sheets summarize the related subjects very briefly and might come of use for faster and more accurate coding. I, personally, take a look at them for rapid review of forgettable syntaxes that might be needed during my projects.
